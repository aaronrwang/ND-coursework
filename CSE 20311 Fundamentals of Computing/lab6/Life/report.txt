The user can either type in just the executable (1 argument) or the executable and the name of a file with data points(2 arguments). Otherwise, the program gives an error of too many arguments
If there is only one argument, the game is controlled by the user with 5 commands: a x y, r x y, n q or p which add a cell, remove a cell, move to next iteration, quit and play forever respectivelly.
If there are two arguments, they see the game played out with the coords taken in from the starting file.

On the programmer's side, a board is initially initialized to all dead cells and printed to screen. It then either repeatedly asks the user for commands or reads the file until 'p'. 
If n is chosen, The program counts the living neighboring cells of each cell and puts an according value in line with the rules in a temp array. After this process, the temp array is copied to the board.
If p is chosem, the command of n, display, delay and clear are looped until ^c is hit.

I verified my output with glider.txt and commonly found sequences like still life, oscillators and space ships.
