    This is because $abc$ represents the last 3 characters that have been read such that it is \str{1} if \str{1} was read and \str{0} otherwise. where $a$ is the third-to-last symbol, $b$ is the second-to-last symbol, and $c$ is the last symbol.\footnote{If nothing has been read yet, aka no ``symbols'' yet, we assume symbols to be \str{0}}
