Let $f(l, \alpha) = w^1w^2 \cdots w^l$ s.t. $w^{(i)} = \alpha$.
For any Unix regular expression that has quantifiers, we can convert it to a regular expression without quantifiers with this process.
\[
    \alpha^{\{m,n\}}=\bigcup_{m\leq l \leq n}\alpha^{\{l,l\}}=\bigcup_{m\leq l \leq n}f(l, \alpha)
\]
Thus, we have a Unix regular expressions that have quantifiers with an equivalent regular expression without quantifiers.
