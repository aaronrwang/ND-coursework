    Proof idea: Reduce the Universal decider to a decider for whether a TM $M$ ever attempts to move its head past the left end of the tape on input $w$.\newp
    Proof:
     \[\text{LEFT}_{TM} = \{\langle M, w \rangle | M \text{ attempts to moves head past the left on input } w\}\]
     Suppose $\text{LEFT}_{TM}$ is decided by $R$. Construct the universal decider $S$.\newp
    $S =$ ``on input $\langle M, w \rangle$
    \begin{quote}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item[1.] Construct $M' = $ ``on input $x$
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item [a.] Prepend $x$ with a $\str{\#}$.
                \item [b.] Run $M$ on $x$ such that whenever the head is on $\str{\#}$, it move R.\footnote{With this modification, $M$ never attempts to move L past the end of the tape.}
                \item [c.] If $M$ accepts, move L to the $\str{\#}$ and then move L one more time and \emph{accept}.
                \item [d.]otherwise, halt.''
            \end{enumerate}
            \item[2.] Run $R$ on $\langle M', w \rangle$.
            \item[3.] \emph{accept} or \emph{reject} according to $R$.''
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{quote}
    Thus, as we have constructed the universal decider $S$, we have a contradiction $\lightning$. Consequently our original claim that $\text{LEFT}_{TM}$ is decidable is false. Therefore, it is undecidable whether a Turing machine $M$, on input $w$, ever attempts to move its head past the left end of the tape.
