# Task 3d

aa.sh takes in an "archive" file (.gz, .tar, .zip), extracts it, and then extracts and analyzes any of the files inside of it by default; an example of a file that gets properly analyzed would be "example.tar.gz"

# Task 4 Extra Credit

-ad X is added as an argument that stipulates the depth to analyze an "archive" file; an example of a file that gets properly analyzed would be "example.tar.gz.zip -ad 1" because it extracts one depth further
