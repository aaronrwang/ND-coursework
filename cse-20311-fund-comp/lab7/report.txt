From the users perspective, the program asks for a file which it reads data from. 
Then a menu is given for the user to choose.
The user can display all data, take a quiz, or ask for information based on years or quit the program.

Internally, the program asks for a file name. (If file is not found it returns)
It then reads all the data from that file and gives the user a menu of options.
Depending on the option, it goes into a function
The display function just redisplays the csv to terminal with printf.
The quiz functions ask for # of questions and then give the state name and ask for other attributes of the state.
The year functions asks for a year and prints the states that were created before/after that year.
The last choice exits the while loops and prints goodbye.

To verify my output, I tried every function of the program several times.
