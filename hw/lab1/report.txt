1. What your program from part 2 is meant to do, from the user's perspective.
My program is supposed to take 2 vectors (3x1) and find the cross product of these 2 vectors.

2. How the program is structured, from the programmer's perspective.

My program first initializes the variables that store user input. It then gives instructions and takes the user input. The three variables at the end are the 3 values of the computed cross product vector. It then prints out this vector back to the user.

3. How you evaluated the program for correctness. Did you verify that it produces correct results? Are there any cases where it produces incorrect results? Why?

I evaluated the program for correctness by checking different pairs of vectors and comparing it to an online cross product calculator. In my testing, my calculator never printed incorrect values.
